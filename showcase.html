      <h3>Cool stuff I've done or been a part of</h3>

      <ul>
        <h4>Things from when I was young:</h4>
        <li>I was a trombonist for 8 years, and participated in marching band, pit orchestra, multiple jazz bands,<br> and I was the top seated trombonist in my high school by the end of my senior year.</li>
        <li>When I was a teenager I began my interest in electronics by setting up old audio equipment in a way that <br>it would connect to my modern devices as a hobby. By the time I was 17 I had a full stereo setup in my room that I had <br> set up by using used electronics and adaptors that I bought to ensure proper compatibility.</li>
        <h4>Things from college and onward:</h4>
        <li>I have been an intern for Caterpillar as an electronics technician intern for over a year and a half as of 11/1/2024. <br> I have had the position for longer than any other intern in the history of the position.</li>
        <li>I am a part of bradley's red team in their Advanced Ethical Hacking course. I can not share more details due to a Non-Disclosure agreement.</li>
