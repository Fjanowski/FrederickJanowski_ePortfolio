      <h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>In my time at bradley I have learned many things about myself, what I enjoy to do, and where I want to go in my life I started my time as a student as an elecrical engineering student. I soon realized that this was not the path I was meant to take, so I instead opted to switch majors to CIS and minor in cybersecurity. I wholeheartedly believe that this was the correct choice, because my outlook on life has never been more positive. I am grateful to my professors, advisors, and everyone along the way who has helped me get to the point where I am now, and I am excited to graduate in May.</p>
